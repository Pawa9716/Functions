        "1. What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n",
        "  - In Python, a function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task and can be called by name, while a method is a function that is associated with an object or class and is invoked using dot notation.\n",
        "  Functions: A function is a named block of code designed to perform a specific task.Functions are called by their name, and they can accept arguments (inputs) and optionally return a value (output).\n",
        "  Example:\n",
        "    def greet(name):\n",
        "      print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "    greet(\"Alice\") # Calling the function\n",
        "  Methods:A method is a function that is defined within a class and is associated with an object (instance) of that class.Methods are called using dot notation on an object (e.g., object.method_name()).\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "    class Dog:\n",
        "        def __init__(self, name):\n",
        "            self.name = name\n",
        "\n",
        "        def bark(self):\n",
        "            print(f\"{self.name} says Woof!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "    my_dog = Dog(\"Buddy\") # Creating an object of the class\n",
        "    my_dog.bark() # Calling the method on the object\n",

        "#2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n",
        "  - In Python, function parameters are placeholders for values that a function will receive, while arguments are the actual values passed to the function when it's called.\n",
        "  Parameters:Parameters are the variables listed in the function definition's parentheses. They act as placeholders for the values that will be passed into the function when it's called.\n",
        "  Example:\n",
        "    def greet(name, greeting): - name and greeting are parameters.\n",
        "  Arguments:Arguments are the values that are actually passed to the function when it's called. They provide the data that the function will use to perform its operations.\n",
        "  Example:\n",
        "    greet(\"Alice\", \"Hello\") - \"Alice\" and \"Hello\" are arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n",
        "  - In Python, we define functions using the def keyword, followed by the function name, parentheses for parameters (optional), and a colon, with the function body indented. To call a function, simply use its name followed by parentheses, optionally with arguments.\n",
        "  \n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "    def greet(name):\n",
        "        print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n",
        "  -The return statement in a Python function serves to terminate the function's execution and send a value back to the caller, allowing the function's output to be used elsewhere in the program.\n",
        "  Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "    def add(x, y):\n",
        "        result = x + y\n",
        "        return result  # Returns the sum of x and y\n",
        "    \n",
        "    sum_result = add(5, 3)  # Call the function and store the returned value\n",
        "    print(sum_result)  # Output: 8\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
        "  - An iterator is an object that represents a stream of data. It allows you to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string) one element at a time. An iterator in Python implements two methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "  __iter__(): This method returns the iterator object itself. It is used to initialize the iterator.\n",
        "\n",
        "  __next__(): This method returns the next item in the sequence. When there are no more items to return, it raises the StopIteration exception.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Example of an Iterator:\n",
        "   List of numbers\n",
        "  numbers = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "   Get an iterator from the list\n",
        "    iterator = iter(numbers)\n",
        "\n",
        "     Use the iterator to iterate through the list\n",
        "  print(next(iterator))  # Output: 1\n",
        "  print(next(iterator))  # Output: 2\n",
        "  print(next(iterator))  # Output: 3\n",
        "  print(next(iterator))  # Raises StopIteration\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
        "  - A generator is a special type of iterator in Python that allows you to iterate over a sequence of values, but unlike lists or other iterables, it yields values one at a time instead of storing the entire sequence in memory. Generators are lazy, meaning they generate values only when needed, which can lead to significant memory efficiency when dealing with large datasets or infinite sequences.\n",
        "  Generators can be defined in two main ways:\n",
        "  Using a Generator Function: A normal function that contains the yield keyword.\n",
        "  Using a Generator Expression: A compact, one-line expression using a syntax similar to list comprehensions.\n",
        "  1. Generator Function:\n",
        "      A generator function is defined just like a normal function, but instead of return, it uses yield to provide values one at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Example of a Generator Function:\n",
        "  A generator function to generate square numbers.\n",
        "  \n",
        "    def square_numbers(n):\n",
        "    \n",
        "    for i in range(n):\n",
        "        \n",
        "    yield i * i\n",

        "  print(next(squares))  # Uncommenting this would raise StopIteration\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. Generator Expression:\n",
        "  A generator expression is similar to a list comprehension but with parentheses instead of square brackets. It's a more compact way to define generators.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Example of a Generator Expression:\n",
        "\n",
        "   Generator expression to generate squares of numbers from 0 to 4\n",
        "    squares_gen = (i * i for i in range(5))\n",
        "\n",
        " Using next() to iterate through the generator\n",
        "    print(next(squares_gen))  # Output: 0\n",
        "    print(next(squares_gen))  # Output: 1\n",
        "    print(next(squares_gen))  # Output: 4\n",

        "7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions.\n",
        "  - Generators provide several advantages over regular functions (those that use return to return values). These advantages primarily revolve around memory efficiency, performance, and lazy evaluation. Letâ€™s explore these advantages in detail:\n",
        "\n",
        "      1. Memory Efficiency\n",
        "      Generators produce values one at a time, only when requested, meaning they do not store the entire sequence in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "      Regular functions (that use return) typically need to store the entire result in memory, which can be problematic for large datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Example:\n",
        "      Imagine you want to calculate the sum of squares of numbers from 1 to 1 million:\n",
        "\n",
        "    Using a regular function (with return):\n",
        "\n",
        "      A regular function would compute and store all values in memory before returning, consuming a lot of space.\n",
        "\n",
        "    def squares(n):\n",
        "    return [i*i for i in range(n)]  # stores all numbers in memory\n",
        "  Using a generator (with yield):\n",
        "\n",
        "  A generator, on the other hand, computes values one by one, reducing memory usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "  def squares(n):\n",
        "    for i in range(n):\n",
        "        yield i*i  # computes one value at a time, no storage\n",
        "  With the generator, you don't need to store the entire list in memory. You can iterate over it without holding all the numbers in RAM, making it much more memory-efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. Lazy Evaluation\n",
        "  Generators allow for lazy evaluation, meaning they compute values only when needed (on-demand).\n",
        "\n",
        "  Regular functions (with return) compute all values immediately and return them all at once, which can be inefficient, especially for large datasets or infinite sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Example:\n",
        "      If you're processing a large file, using a generator will allow you to read and process one line at a time rather than reading the entire file into memory.\n",
        "\n",
        " Generator to process file line by line (lazy evaluation)\n",
        "    def read_lines(file_name):\n",
        "    with open(file_name, 'r') as file:\n",
        "        for line in file:\n",
        "            yield line.strip()  # yields one line at a time\n",
        "\n",
        " Iterate over lines\n",
        "  for line in read_lines('large_file.txt'):\n",
        "     process each line\n",
        "    print(line)\n",
        "  This method is much more efficient than reading all lines at once and storing them in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "  3. Improved Performance\n",
        "  Generators can improve performance by allowing processing of large datasets or infinite sequences without the need to wait for the entire dataset to be processed or returned.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Regular functions must compute and store all the results at once, which can be slow and resource-intensive for large datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Example: Calculating Fibonacci Numbers\n",
        "      Regular function: A regular function would return a list of all Fibonacci numbers up to a specified number, storing the entire sequence in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "  def fibonacci(n):\n",
        "    fib_list = [0, 1]\n",
        "    for i in range(2, n):\n",
        "        fib_list.append(fib_list[i-1] + fib_list[i-2])\n",
        "    return fib_list\n",
        "  Generator function: A generator function allows you to generate each Fibonacci number on demand, improving performance and memory usage.\n",

        "    while True:  # Infinite sequence of Fibonacci numbers\n",
        "        yield a\n",
        "        a, b = b, a + b\n",
        "  With the generator, the Fibonacci numbers are computed and yielded one by one as needed, instead of generating the entire sequence upfront.\n",
        "\n",
        "  4. Infinite Sequences\n",
        "  Generators are ideal for generating infinite sequences because they only produce values when requested and donâ€™t require storing the entire sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Regular functions (using return) would require generating and storing the entire sequence, which is not feasible for infinite sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Example:\n",
        "      If you want to generate an infinite sequence of prime numbers:\n",
        "\n",
        "  Using a regular function:\n",
        "\n",
        "  You would need to store all the prime numbers in a list, which is not possible for an infinite sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Using a generator:\n",
        "\n",
        "  A generator allows you to generate primes on-demand, making it feasible to wo\n",
        "    def generate_primes():\n",
        "    num = 2\n",
        "    while True:  # Infinite loop\n",
        "        if all(num % i != 0 for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1)):\n",
        "            yield num\n",
        "        num += 1\n",
        "\n",
        " Get the first 10 primes\n",
        "  prime_gen = generate_primes()\n",
        "    for _ in range(10):\n",
        "    print(next(prime_gen))\n",
        "  This generator will keep producing primes indefinitely without consuming all memory, as opposed to trying to store an infinite list of primes.\n",
        "\n",
        "  5. Code Simplicity and Readability\n",
        "  Generators can often simplify your code by removing the need for manually handling state and iterating through items in loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Regular functions (using return) often require more boilerplate code to create and manage the entire sequence before returning it.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Example:\n",

        "\n",
        "  Requires initializing a list and manually appending to it.\n",

        "  def even_numbers(n):\n",
        "    result = []\n",
        "    for i in range(n):\n",
        "        if i % 2 == 0:\n",
        "            result.append(i)\n",
        "    return result\n",
        "  Generator function (using yield):\n",
        "\n",
        "  Much simpler and cleaner.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "    def even_numbers(n):\n",
        "    for i in range(n):\n",
        "        if i % 2 == 0:\n",
        "            yield i  # yield values one by one\n",
        "The generator simplifies the code by removing the need to explicitly maintain a list, reducing complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "  6. State Retention Between Iterations\n",
        "  Generators retain their state between successive calls to next(). After yielding a value, a generator function \"pauses\", and on the next call, it resumes execution from where it left off.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Regular functions do not retain any state between calls. They always restart their execution from the top when called again.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Example:\n",
        "   Generator example with state retention\n",
        "    def count_up_to(n):\n",
        "    count = 1\n",
        "    while count <= n:\n",
        "        yield count  # retains state and continues from here on next call\n",
        "        count += 1\n",
        "\n",
        "  counter = count_up_to(3)\n",
        "  print(next(counter))  # Output: 1\n",
        "  print(next(counter))  # Output: 2\n",
        "  print(next(counter))  # Output: 3\n",
        "  Calling next() again would raise StopIteration\n",
        "  In contrast, a regular function would not retain any of the state between calls.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
        "  - In Python, a lambda function is a small, anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword, typically used for short, one-time operations, and can take any number of arguments but only return a single expression.\n",

        "\n",
        "9. Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python.\n",
        "  - The Python map() function applies a given function to each item in an iterable (like a list or tuple) and returns an iterator that yields the results, effectively \"mapping\" the function across the iterable's elements\n",

        "10. What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python?\n",
        "  - In Python, map(), reduce(), and filter() are functional programming tools that allow you to operate on sequences (like lists) and apply functions to their elements in a concise, efficient manner. These functions work in a similar way but serve different purposes and have different behaviors.\n",
